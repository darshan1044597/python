create a tuple named 'fruits' with repeated values like ("apple", "banana", "apple", "cherry", "banana", "apple")
prompt the user to enter the name of a fruit and store it in a variable called 'fruit_name'
use the 'count()' method of the tuple to find how many times fruit_name appears in the tuple
store the result in a variable called 'count'
print a message showing how many times the fruit appears in the tuple in the format: ''1fruit_name' appears count times in the tuple'
