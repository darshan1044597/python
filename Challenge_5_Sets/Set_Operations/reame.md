# Challenge 4: Set Operations

## Concept
Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference
## Objective
Combine and compare sets using set operations
## What you need to do:
- Create two sets: `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4}` and `set2 = {3, 4, 5, 6}`.
- Use the set operations to find and print:
  - The **union** of the two sets.
  - The **intersection** of the two sets.
  - The **difference** between `set1` and `set2`.
