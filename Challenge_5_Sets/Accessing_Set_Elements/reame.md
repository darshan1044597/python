# Challenge 2: Accessing Set Elements

## Concept:
Understanding that sets are unordered and unindexed
## oBjective:
Use iteration to access elements in a set
## What you need to do:
- Create a set called `colors` with the following items: `'red'`, `'blue'`, `'green'`, and `'yellow'`.
- Use a `for` loop to print each color in the set.

### Example Code:

```python
# Create a set with colors
colors = {'red', 'blue', 'green', 'yellow'}

# Loop through the set and print each color
for color in colors:
    print(color)
