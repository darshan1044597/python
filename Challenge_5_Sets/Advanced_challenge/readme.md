# Challenge 3: Frozen Sets and Immutability

## Concept:
- Understanding the immutability of frozensets

## Objective:
- Work with frozensets to understand their immutability.

## Task:
1. Create a frozenset frozen_numbers = frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}).
2. Attempt to add an element to the frozenset (this should result in an error).
3. Print the frozenset.
